Current language models are not able to capture nuance in linguistic expressions in a transparent way. To model this nuance, we need transparent language models that are grounded in linguistics and cognitive science. A possible answer to this problem is the DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical) framework, that explicitly models both the syntax and semantics of language. It has been successfully used for modelling the meaning of existing text. This research focuses on extending the DisCoCat framework for creative natural language generation. More specifically, we focus on generating text in the light verb construction domain. This research will give us a deeper understanding of how semantic spaces interact to convey meaning in language.
